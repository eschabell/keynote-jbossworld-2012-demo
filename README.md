JBoss Keynote Demo from JBossWorld 2012 Quickstart Guide
========================================================

A fully automated setup project to allow you to locally demo the JBoss World Keynote 2012 application. You want to be a JBoss Rock Star? Now you can!

Demo based on JBoss EAP6 and the existing code base of the Keynote demo.

Setup and Configuration
-----------------------

This is now completely automoated, just run the init.sh script provided. Note you need to download JBoss EAP 6 as stated in the
README found in the installs directory. The init.sh script will end with a very descriptive explaination of how to start the demo
and what to access to get started.

Future work, get this to work with BRMS 5.3.

Enjoy!
